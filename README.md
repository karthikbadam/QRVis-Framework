# QRVis-Framework


A web application framework for sharing visualizations across devices through QR codes.
QR-Vis is currently under development and we are rapidly improving it. Please contact us if you are interested and would like to contribute to our project. 

## To build:

Prerequisites (both Windows and Unix):
    
    * Python 2.6 or 2.7  
    * Visual Studio 2010 or 2012 (Windows)
    * GCC 4.2 or newer (Unix) 
    * Node.js (http://nodejs.org/download/)
    
How to build:

    * git clone https://github.com/karthikbadam/QRVis-Framework.git
    * make all
    
This builds the QR-Vis framework library modules. To try out the examples, just copy the _examples/_ folder to a HTTP server (for example, [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/)).
