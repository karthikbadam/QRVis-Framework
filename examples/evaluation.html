    var txt = 'Two Guys in a Garage>>When the bashful programmer and the high-strung computerbuilder find themselves without jobs, paychecks, governmentsecurity clearances, or viable character references, they dowhat any desperate men would do--they start a high-techcompany.<<by M. Peshota As the two former defense workers headed to S-maxsvan, they reflected on the loss of their jobs, theirpaychecks, and their dignity, as well as their blastedreputations.I have never been happier, the computer buildersaid, strolling through the parking garage, the fake zebrafur from his computer chair draped over his arm. And tothink, we escaped the whole fiasco without being even madethe subject of some lengthy TV mini-series. He gruntedwith glee. Or a congressional investigation. The programmer shuffling behind him, his arms full ofboxes stuffed with fur dice, Honk If You Want CompleteSchematics bumper-stickers, a plaster bust of John F.Kennedy, and all the other effluvium from their formeroffice, didnt reply. He was too stricken with grief at theloss of his first engineering job to speak. Did I ever tell you how I was once the subject of acongressional investigation? S-max continued. Andrew.BAS wanted to reply that no, he had not toldhim, nor was he surprised that the mischievous S-max hadbeen the subject of a congressional investigation, but hewas too sad to answer. This nudnik congressman thought fer sure that I wasthe source of a recent spate of computer terrorism inSurinam, but I wasnt. I was in Guyana at the time. Hegrunted innocently. I think I read about that in the papers. You most likely did. I received much fan mail aftermy verile profile was transmitted over the wire services.Although many of the pictures that female correspondentssent of themselves >>did<< appear to have prison numbers onthem. He grunted again. Andrew.BAS recalled a newspaper story he had once readabout a raggedy computer whiz who had practically takenCongress hostage, ranting and raving for hours in front of amicrophone about various outdated computer architectures.How could he have known that he would one day find himselfsharing his office--and his home even--with this samegoofball? Had he known he probably would have foresaken hischildhood dream of leading an impeccably logical life andbecome an art history major instead. S-max spotted the gloom on the programmers face. Hefelt sorry for him, then realized with a start that this wasthe very first time he had ever felt sorry for a computerprogrammer. Usually he did not feel sorry for programmers.Usually he felt they deserved whatever they got. But hecouldnt help thinking of how hard it must have been on theyoung programmer when the evil and demonic Gus Farwick hadphoned his parents and informed them that their son hadprogrammed a smart bomb to write Goose Farwook Sings theBig Kahuna across the sky. (When Farwick had demanded thatS-max tell him the truth about who had been the mastermindbehind the bombs blasphemy, the computer builder couldnthelp it, the name Andrew.BAS had just slipped from hismouth.) S-maxs parents, on the other hand, were not at allsurprised when the engineer-manager called to tell them whattheir socially-challenged offspring had been up to.(Unfortunately, Farwick hadnt believed for a second thatAndrew.BAS was the one most responsible for the bomb thathad embarrassed him in front of half of the Pentagonsweapons shopaholics. He may flaunt a job title that wasappended by the word manager, but he was not stupid.) Not surprisingly, S-maxs parents initially deniedhaving ever heard of him. They even denied that their namewas Maxwell or that they had ever lived at the same addressas anyone with a big nose and an orange and black afro.Only when pressed, did they admit--between sobs--thatSherwood Franklin Maxwell, self-proclaimed computer genius,was indeed their child. After that, they sympathizedprofusely with his former boss. They even invited him overto dinner and offered to do whatever they could to help thedefense contractor pick up the pieces in the wake of theirchilds calamitous employment there. As S-max and Andrew.BAS shoved the boxes full of furdice and Honk If You Want Complete Schematics bumperstickers into the back of S-maxs dilapidated van, thecomputer builder patted the programmer on the shouldercompassionately. Farwick will regret it, he assured him.He will wake up tomorrow and realize what he has done--thatin one flash of blind and ignorant rage he fired his twomost whimsical employees. It will forever after that seemto him like nothing but a horrible dream. Im sure it does already, Andrew.BAS said. They crawled into the front seat. As the computerbuilder steered the satellite dish-topped van down the steepgarage ramp with daredevilish swerves, he reflected on whatthey should do with the rest of their lives. We could raise labrador retrievers, he suggested. Do you want to build the kennel? Do you really think one is necessary? The programmer frowned. How he had gotten himself intothis mess with such a loonball he would never know.Sometimes he felt his life was being authored by, not byFate, but a sadistic sitcom writer whose last paying gig wasThe Gong Show. S-max continued, We could go on a lecture tour. What would we lecture about? Stuff. Stuff? We could simply rail on and on for several hours in anentertaining fashion about things that irk us, then pass outfloppy disks full of free software afterward. Like you did before Congress? Very similar, but we probably wouldnt have to quoteso much from Thus Spake Zarathustra. This sounds like something you could do without myhelp. I think youre right. Were we to go on the roadtogether I suspect it wouldnt be long before Id be itchingto branch off into a solo career. The programmer looked out the cracked window at thestreet and sighed. S-max rattled on, We could hire ourselves out asconsultants. What kind of advice would we give? We could... He paused, uncertain. We could tellpeople how to play their video games correctly. And? Do we have to tell them anything else? If theyre paying us we do. Youre sure about this? Certain. Thats really too bad. S-max swerved around afireplug in a broad, illegal U-turn over a grassy island.Both considered the problem in silence, stunned by theenormity of it. Tentatively, the computer buildersuggested, We could start a high-tech company together? With you? He bristled, Yes, with me. Its not like I haventstarted high-tech companies lots of times before. You have? Yes, I have. All you need is a post office box andone of those little trays that you use to process creditcards. Its not that hard. Andrew.BAS considered. <<Start a business.>> Itwasnt such a bad idea afterall, once he got over thedisbelief of the notion of starting a company with someoneas capricious as S-max. They could sell software by mail,and maybe some ingenious computer hardware device too, if S-max dreamed one up. They could run the business out oftheir home. No one would ever know it was just a weatheredA-frame with fraternity letters on the front rail. Theycould install a bank of phones in the livingroom, and answerthe ringing phones crisply, and make it sound like theircompany inhabited a sleek office tower. They could put thecomputers in the livingroom too. They could work wheneverthey liked--late into the night if they wished, and takeregular breaks to watch Star Trek episodes. His eyeswidened. He especially liked that part about taking breaksto watch Star Trek. His mind reeled with thepossibilities. Do you really think we could? he bubbled finally. S-max snorted pompously. Like I said, Ive startedhigh-tech companies <<oodles>> of times. The programmers mind was too muddied by grief at theloss of his first job to see things clearly and ask aboutthe outcome of those <<oodles>> of times. Instead, hebrightened and grew enthusiastic about the possibility ofgoing into business with the hardware hacker. But do wehave all the stuff wed need to start a high-tech company?he asked. Look-- S-max pointed over his shoulder toward thejunk in the back of the van. We got a bust of John F.Kennedy, he said, referring to the bust of the technology-booster president with the pocket protector pencilled on hischest, looking lonely and afraid. We got a model ofSputnik. He pointed to the plastic rocket propped againsta pile of boxes. Its a model of the Apollo 11, Andrew.BAS corrected. Whatever. We got a complimentary copy of guidedmissile software that writes Goose Farwick Sings the BigKahuna in the sky. He pointed to the printouts tangled atthe base of the Apollo. A complimentary copy? Well its a copy. He grunted, not caring to divulgehow he had smuggled classified software out of the defensecontractor. What more do we need? A product? He shrugged. Thats hardly as important as having acopy of guided missile software that writes in the skyGoose Farwook Sings the Big Kahuna. He smirked. And thats how it began. Two guys sharing in that mostmagical moment of modern capitalism: the union of two newlyunemployed men and an ill-defined dream. Later, they wouldreminisce about this moment--Andrew.BAS blaming S-max, S-maxblaming Andrew.BAS. At least once the police would becalled to break up the scuffle that arose in the course ofreminiscence. But for now, it was all silicon and gossamer,and fantasies of growing rich enough to get all of S-maxssoldering irons out of hock. As the two wannabe entrepreneurs roared down thefreeway, they spoke of technology in brave visionary terms.Each attested to the thrill of invention, both drewparallels between the number of patents that would beregistered in their names and the number of Wall Streetmoney bins that would bear their famous monograms.Andrew.BAS recounted the inspiring tale of Bill Gates who,like him, had one day been a freckle-nosed squirt writingBASIC programs in his college dorm room and the next hadenough money in his checking account to finance thecolonization of little known star systems. S-max dreamedabout someday having a credit line big enough to wagehostile takeovers of bloated computer manufacturers withnothing but an American Express card. Since youre going to be my business partner, theressomething I would like you to know about me, Andrew.BAS, heannounced. The programmer glanced at him with a frightenedcuriosity, not knowing what to expect. I would like to share a secret about my inner self,he said, zig-zagging the van from one lane into another onthe freeway with a kamikaze abruptness that caused the tiresto squeel, horns to honk, and the satellite dish on top thevan to creak and shiver. I have never told this to anyonebefore. I dont know why Im confiding this now in a mereprogrammer such as yourself, since its unlikely you willunderstand. You can have no way of empathizing with theprimitive desires of a hardware hacker such as myself.Maybe its because I still feel guilty about having told GusFarwick that you were the one who programmed the bomb todestroy a chicken coop because you considered it the mythicarchetype for the design of his intellect-- I did no such--! Please! Do not tarnish the sanctity of this momentwith your squeels of innocence. I am about to confide animportant secret about myself! The programmer was quiet. This is something that must be said, something thatmust be said now before our business plans go any further.His voice grew grave. Without knowing this bit of truthabout me, you will never understand me or the computers Idesign, you will never understand why I lead the life I do.It is a reality that is at the heart of my technical genius,a truth that courses through every fiber of my being like asavage animal instinct. He leaned over and whispered, Ihave always wanted to buy IBM. You buy IBM!? Yes, me, wild and impossible as it may seem. I would have never guessed it. Its true! Often, I lay away at night dreaming of howI would refurbish their entire line of silly computers byadding super-cooled circuits, gallium arsenide chips,parallel processing, game ports, 300-key keyboards, andbuilt-in soft-serve ice-cream makers. He gruntedblissfully. Of course, I would also put an end to theiremployees unnatural obsession with coordinating the colorof their belts with their wallets. With that, he turned the van into the driveway of theirhouse and his request that Andrew.BAS get out and check theground to make sure that no pieces of his satellite dish hadfallen in the driveway appeared to signal the end of theconversation. Later that afternoon, after they had unpacked the JohnF. Kennedy bust, the fuzzy dice, the guided missilesoftware, the Honk If You Want Complete Schematics bumperstickers, the model rocket, and all the other flotsam fromtheir office, they confronted the cold fact that neitherknew exactly what it meant to be incorporated (S-maxinsisted it was a sort legal limbo found only in the stateof Nevada), neither was sure whether Customer Service was aNew Age movement or a sign you hang on the john, andboth were completely baffled as to whether a businessproposal was a form you file with the IRS or a legal defenseyou use when your investors try to boot you out.';
